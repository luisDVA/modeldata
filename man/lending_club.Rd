\details{
These data were downloaded from the Lending Club
access site (see below) and are from the first quarter of 2016.
A subset of the rows and variables are included here. The
outcome is in the variable \code{Class} and is either "good" (meaning
that the loan was fully paid back or currently on-time) or "bad"
(charged off, defaulted, of 21-120 days late). A data dictionary
can be found on the source website.
