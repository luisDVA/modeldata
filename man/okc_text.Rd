These are a sample of columns and users from the OkCupid dating
website. The data are from Kim and Escobedo-Land (2015).
Permission to use this data set was explicitly granted by
OkCupid, but since that time, concerns have been raised about
the ethics of using this or similar data sets, for example to
identify individuals (see the original journal article as well
as letter below). This data set will be removed entirely from
this package in a future release.
